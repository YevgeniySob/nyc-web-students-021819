React Best Practices
====================

## SWBAT

- [ ] Begin using the React Dev Tools
- [ ] Write cleaner React code

## Objectives

**Opinions**

- [x] Code Organization
  - folders, imports, methods
- [x] Presentational vs Container components
  - Explore the distinction and why everything is opinion
  - Container component -> component where most of your logic and state are managed
  - Presentational component -> component whose sole responsiblility is to display stuff

  - Presentational === functional, container === class

**The More You Know**

- [x] Functional vs Class Components
  - [x] Implicit return for Functional components
  - [x] What is PureComponent?
- [x] Fragments
- [ ] defaultProps and propTypes
- [x] Callbacks (avoid useless wrapping)
- Syntax often seen in React:
  - [x] Arrow functions returning objects
  - [x] Destructuring -> cool!
  - [x] Spread (w/ prepend and append) -> cool!
  - [x] Objects with the same key/value name
  - [x] constructor vs. ES7 instance variables
  - [x] map (as a way to update objects in an array of objects) -> cool!
  - [x] { [variable]: "as_key" }
