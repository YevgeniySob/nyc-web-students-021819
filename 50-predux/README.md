## Notes

[Wiki: Message Passing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing)

```
"Message passing is a technique for invoking behavior (i.e., running a program) on a computer. In contrast to the traditional technique of calling a program by name, message passing uses an object model to distinguish the general function from the specific implementations. The invoking program sends a message and relies on the object to select and execute the appropriate code." -Wikipedia
